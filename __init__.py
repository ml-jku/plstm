"""Parametric LSTM (pLSTM) implementation in JAX and PyTorch.

This package provides implementations of the Parametric LSTM architecture in both JAX and PyTorch.
The implementations are separated into two submodules:
- plstm.jax: JAX implementation
- plstm.torch: PyTorch implementation

To use the JAX implementation, install with: pip install plstm[jax]
To use the PyTorch implementation, install with: pip install plstm[torch]
